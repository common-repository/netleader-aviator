Aircraft Weight and Balance calculator for flying clubs and organizations.

== Description ==

Quickly calculates aircraft weight and balance, including a graphic CG envelope, using aircraft profiles created by maintenance officers or administrators from official aircraft documents. Pilots need only enter the weights for a planned loading. Weight and Balance is automatically recalculated after each entry. Zero fuel weight and CG are also calculated. NetLeader Aviator was written with single engine aircraft in mind although it is not limited to them. For educational purposes only.
